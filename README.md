# HW-project
The repository has been created to find out how git and github work, as well as practise making commits, uploading and tracking changes.
In the project folder you can find Money Keeper App and a landing page, but this folder contains some unnecessary side files too. Therefore You had better head to one of the repositories to appraise the mentioned objectives.
